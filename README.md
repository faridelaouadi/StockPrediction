Stock Price Prediction using Scikit learn and MatplotLib 

Motivation
----------

- I spoke to a quant trader during my spring week at J.P.Morgan about his job. My interest in machine learning and algorithmic trading increased and so i decided to get my hands dirty and experiment with it.

1) Found historical data as a csv file of the stock i wanted to predict (Apple) using Yahoo Finance. 
2) Used Scikit learn to predict the price of that stock for a future date using Quadratic, linear regression as well as KNN. 
3) Visualise the results for the best performing model ( in my case it was KNN ) using matplotlib


Things to do 
---
- Improve the GUI to dynamically change the visualisation depending on what stock the user chooses 
- Sentiment analysis to skew the predicted price based on recent news

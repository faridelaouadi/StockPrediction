Stock Price Prediction using Scikit learn

Steps taken in Project
1) Found historical data as a csv file of the stock i want to predict using Yahoo Finance. 
2) Used Scikit learn to predict the price of that stock for a future date using Quadratic, linear regression as well as KNN. 
3) Visualise the results for the best performing model ( in my case it was KNN ) using matplotlib

Here is the visualisation:
